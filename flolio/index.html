            <h2>Hello Guy</h2>
            <p>I'm Vitt Mony (scriper), a graphic designer currently employed at a company in Poipet. I enjoy learning from those around me and cherish a quiet life; I find solace in solitude. Nonetheless, I also recognize the importance of communication, especially with my senior professors and teachers, as I strive to broaden my knowledge.
            During my university years, I pursued studies in IT (Information Technology), with a particular passion for web development and design. While I may not have excelled academically, I am not averse to learning. I am eager to delve into new technological advancements and continuously enhance my skill set.
            Reflecting on my childhood, I recall being drawn to technology from as early as eight years old. Despite not owning a smartphone or personal computer at the time, I avidly watched Khmer news segments covering technology and games. It was then that I became enamored with the idea of creating technological applications and games to benefit society. My love for drawing further fueled my interest in graphics design and web development, ultimately guiding me towards my current career path.
            I firmly believe that discovering one's passion is key to happiness and fulfillment. For me, this journey began by reminiscing about childhood interests and evaluating present-day joys. It is through this introspection that I have found my calling, and I am eager to continue pursuing it.
            </p><p>Thank you all for your attention.</p>
